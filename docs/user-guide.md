# WatermarkLab User Guide

## Getting Started

WatermarkLab is a web-based platform for visualizing watermarking algorithm performance comparisons.

## Model Selection

1. Navigate to the "Select Models" page
2. Browse available watermarking models
3. Click on models to select them for comparison
4. Use "Import Models" to add custom models
5. Click "Enter System" to proceed to visualization

## Visualization Features

### Experiment Settings
View configuration parameters for selected models.

### Visual Quality Metrics
Compare PSNR, SSIM, and FID scores across models.

### Robustness Comparison
Analyze watermark robustness under various attacks:
- Overall ranking
- Specific attack performance
- Detailed line charts

### Attack Performance
Rank attack effectiveness across different methods.

## Supported Model Types

- **PGW (Post-Generation Watermark)**: Watermark embedded in existing images
- **IGW (In-Generation Watermark)**: Watermark embedded during image generation

## Data Format

Models and results are stored in JSON format for easy integration and sharing.
